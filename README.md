## Video Player

Does this exist in another package already or does everyone just write their own?

Requirements
- basic CLI availability
- can play a single video
- can optionally scale output
- can display a side by side window for debugging
- video annotations supported
- pass in arbitrary frame-level filters or operations


# Dev

These aren't guaranteed to work in another environment, need to make more generalizable at some point

1. `python -m venv venv `
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `make dev`
4. `make test-files`

# Tests

- Should include an E2E test that can be validated visually (and possibly quantitatively)
